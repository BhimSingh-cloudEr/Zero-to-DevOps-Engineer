# The 3-Month DevOps Challenge: From Zero to DevOps Engineer
### Introduction
In today’s fast-paced software development world, DevOps is no longer optional—it’s essential. DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations, enabling faster delivery, better quality, and greater reliability of software systems.

If you're aspiring to become a DevOps engineer or upskill into cloud-native automation, this 3-Month DevOps Challenge is your roadmap. With focused weekly goals and hands-on tool usage, you’ll build a solid foundation in just 90 days.

### Month-by-Month Roadmap
### Month 1: Foundation of DevOps & Infrastructure
#### Goals:
Understand DevOps principles
Learn Linux, Networking, and Bash scripting
Set up Git and CI/CD basics

#### Topics:
What is DevOps?
Agile vs DevOps

Git Bash / Ubuntu – Practice CLI on Windows

### Month 2: CI/CD, Containers, and Automation
#### Goals:
Set up full CI/CD pipelines
Learn Docker and container orchestration
Automate infrastructure with Ansible

#### Topics:
Jenkins pipelines (declarative + scripted)
Build & deploy Java/Python apps
Dockerfile, images, volumes, networking
Docker Compose
Ansible playbooks & inventory
YAML basics

#### Tools & Services:
Jenkins – CI/CD pipeline automation
Docker & Docker Hub – Container creation and sharing
Ansible – Configuration management and automation
OWASP Dependency Check / Trivy – Security scanning
SonarQube
Maven / Gradle / npm – Build tools

### Month 3: Cloud, Kubernetes, Monitoring & Final Project
#### Goals:
Deploy apps on the cloud
Use Kubernetes for orchestration
Monitor and secure infrastructure

#### Topics:
AWS / Azure basics: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC
Terraform basics for infrastructure as code
Kubernetes objects: Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress
Helm charts
Prometheus, Grafana

DevSecOps basics: shift-left security, CI scanning

#### Tools & Services:

Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Kubernetes + kubectl + Minikube – Container orchestration
Helm – Kubernetes package management
Prometheus + Grafana – Monitoring and visualization
SonarQube – Code quality analysis
Vault / AWS Secrets Manager – Secret management

#### Final Capstone Project
By the end of the challenge, build and deploy a complete cloud-native application:

Include:
GitHub repo
Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
Dockerized app
Terraform scripts for cloud infra
Kubernetes deployment
Monitoring dashboard
